# HawkSite - A web server used by Wilfrid Laurier Univeristy professors to manage student's grade database.
The goal of the project was to create a web server that interacts with web users and a locally hosted database, where the web server is Apache and the database is MySQL. The server-side language that was used was PHP, and this was all set up on a Windows device. The project requires the execution of at least two different SQL statements initiated by web users, we chose to do a SELECT and UPDATE statement for this. The database will consist of two tables, Name Table and Course Table. A requirement of the project is to output all of the student's final calculated grades based on the data in the two input tables. The output format is specified to project requirements.

The files containing the PHP and HTML code for the interface and functionality of the project are located within a folder in the Apache directory. This allows them to be accessed and run from a browser. Because of this, when the web user interacts with the web page and manipulates entries in the database, the locally hosted MySQL database will be affected by these changes. Each HTML form links to a PHP script that is run server-side to handle the user inputs and retrieve data from the database.
